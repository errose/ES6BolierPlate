# MoO Accordion

The Accordion collapses/condenses large amounts of data or content allowing the user to make the choice of which content to view.

When collapsed, the panel’s height accounts only for the panel’s header height. By default, `.Accordion-panelBody` has the styles of opacity: 0, visibility: invisible and height: 0. 

When the `.is-open` class is added to the `.Accordion-panel` element, the `.Accordion-panelBody` styles are changed to `opacity: 1`, `visibility: visible` and `height: auto`. This expands the `.Accordion-panel` height to account for the both the `.Accordion-panelHeader` and `.Accordion-panelBody` elements.

### JS/JQuery
If the CDN scripts.js file is included on the project, there are two things that will need to be set up:
* `.Accordion-Trigger` is attached to an `<a>` tag whose href (#panel-1) is the same as the panel id (id=”panel-1”)
* The data attribute data-accordion-trigger is present on the `.Accordion-Trigger` element as well

If the CDN scripts.js file is not included, a function must be created that will add the `.is-open` class to the `.Accordion-panel` of the `.Accordion-panelHeader` element that was clicked.

### Angular
If using are Angular, you will need to have an `ng-click` expression on the panel’s `.Accordion-Trigger` element. The `ng-click` expression would update the ng-class expression on the `.Accordion-panel`, adding and removing an `.is-open` class.

Tip: By default, nesting Accordions is not possible. If an Accordion is nested by adding the `.is-open` class to a panel, all of the panels that are nested would be open as well. Nesting is possible but would require some custom styling.
