# MoO Utility Typography

## Overview
Mutual of Omaha uses two typefaces as the official corporate fonts, Meta and Minion. These fonts are the default typefaces for all Mutual of Omaha marketing assets. They are used in specific cases to ensure readability and to help maintain a consistent look and feel throughout all marketing materials both digital and physical. To best represent our brand, the two typefaces should be used concurrently. When our corporate fonts are not available, web-standard fonts Arial and Georgia are used instead, respectively.

### Meta

For headlines, pull quotes and highlighted copy, Meta Pro is used since it is a strong typeface and can stands out strong on a layout.

In the event Meta is not available on the client, Arial should be set as the fallback.

### Minion

For all other body copy, Minion Pro is used for its classic look and readability at smaller sizes. It represents Mutual of Omaha’s stability and history as a traditional company.

Georgia should be set as a fallback, in the event Minion is not available.

```html
<p>This is Mutual of Omaha's chosen Typography set.<br/>
We use <strong class="u-fontSansSerif">Meta Pro</strong> as our headings.<br/>
All font sizes use <code>rem</code> with a <code>px</code> fallback.<br/>
We use <strong class="u-fontSerif">Minion Pro</strong> as our body Copy with the base font size of <strong>1.8rem</strong> and the <code>line-height</code> of <strong>3.2rem</strong>.</p>
```

## Headings
Meta Pro is used in headings and headlines. There are six primary types of headings available through the standard header HTML tags.
```html
<h1>H1: Header <strong>One</strong> and Only Brand Blue</h1>
<h2>H2: Starting Dark Gray Now with Heading <strong>Two</strong></h2>
<h3>H3: Lucky Number <strong>Three</strong> is Going, Going, Gone</h3>
<h4>H4: July <strong>Four</strong> Twenty Fourteen is Coming Soon</h4><br/>
<h5>H5: Alive Going <strong>Five</strong> Headers that are all Four Pixels Changing</h5><br/>
<h6>H6: Small and Mighty <strong>Six</strong> May be the Only Bolder Header at Four Hundred Weight</h6>
```

## Body Copy
Minion Pro is used as the default typeface for all other body copy. Body copy is typically set by using a paragraph and list tags.
```html
<p>Here is some body copy.</p>
<ul>
    <li>And some body copy&hellip;</li>
    <li>&hellip; in a list.
```
___

## Measurement
All fonts use `rem` (root em) as the default form of size measurement with a `px` (pixel) fallback.
___

## Weights
Various weights can be applied to the Meta (sans serif) font as an alternative to using a strong tag for bold text. There are six different weights to choose from: `.u-fontWeight200` `.u-fontWeight300` `.u-fontWeight400` `.u-fontWeight500` `.u-fontWeight600` `.u-fontWeight700` 

```html
<p class="u-fontWeight200">This is the font weight of 200</p>
<p class="u-fontWeight300">This is the font weight of 300</p>
<p class="u-fontWeight400">This is the font weight of 400</p>
<p class="u-fontWeight500">This is the font weight of 500</p>
<p class="u-fontWeight600">This is the font weight of 600</p>
<p class="u-fontWeight700">This is the font weight of 700</p>
```
___

## Font Style
The font face style should automatically be chosen per the element being displayed. However, an alternative style can be forced via one of the following classes: `.u-fontSerif` to force the serif type face, or `.u-fontSansSerif` to force the sans serif type face. An optional condensed font face can also be utilized by applying the `.u-fontCondensed` class. Please note: these classes should be used sparingly as each element automatically utilizes the type face that works best for readability.
```html
<p class="u-fontSansSerif">Sans Serif</p>
<p class="u-fontSerif">Serif</p>
<p class="u-fontCondensed">Condensed</p>
```
___

## Links
To create a link to a URL, apply an anchor tag around the applicable text.
```html
<p>This is a <a>link</a> in some text</p>
```
___


## Strong, Italic, Underlined, and Small
Text can be formatted in various forms. By applying standard HTML tags, the applicable text will change accordingly. For bold text, use the strong tag, or apply the `.u-fontBold` class alternatively.  For underlined text, use the u tag, or apply the `.u-fontUnderline` class. For italicized text, use the em tag, or apply the `.u-fontItalic` class. And for small text, use the small tag, or apply the `.u-fontSmall` class.
```html
<p>This is <strong>bold</strong> text</p>
<p>This is <u>underlined</u> text</p>
<p>This is <em>italicized</em> text</p>
<p>This text is <small>small</small></p>
```
*`u-fontBold`, `u-fontUnderline`, `u-fontItalic`, and 'u-fontSmall' also available.*
___

## Lists
To build an unordered list, use standard HTML formatting of a parent `ul` tag with children `li` (list item) tags. You may also use an `ol` tag to create an ordered list.
•	Unordered lists - use li (list item) tags
•	Ordered lists – use ol (ordered list) tags
```html
<ul>
  <li>This is a list item</li>
  <li>This is a list item
    <ul>
        <li>This is a list item nested within another list.
            <ul>
                <li>One more level.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This is a list item</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>This is a list item</li>
  <li>This is a list item
    <ol>
        <li>This is a list item nested within another list.
            <ol>
                <li>One more level.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>This is a list item</li>
</ol>
```
___

## Text Alignment/Position
Text can be aligned left, right, or centered. Utilize the .u-textLeft class to force left alignment, `.u-textRight` for right alignment, and `.u-textCenter` for center alignment. These classes can also be triggered in regard to the responsive layout by adding the `-sm`, `-md`, `-lg` suffixes to the class names.

Responsive sizes also available (`-sm`, `-md`, `-lg`).
```html
<div class="u-textCenter">Center</div>
<div class="u-textLeft">Left</div>
<div class="u-textRight">Right</div>
```
___

## Misc.
Body copy can inherit the color of its parent element’s copy by applying the `.u-fontInheritColor` class.
Copy can also be set to not wrap to another line by applying the `.u-textNoWrap` class.
Applying `.u-textTruncate` to a block element will truncate its text based on the width of its parent container.
Text can be set to all uppercase by utilizing the `.u-textCaps` class.
