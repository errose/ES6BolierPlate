# MoO Container Wrap
The ContainerWrap classes allow for a background image or background color to be fluid with content height. There are several options:

## Standard / Before
Use ContainerWrap-before to place the background style on the left and content on the right 
```html
<div class="ContainerWrap u-bgRedLighter">
  <div class="ContainerWrap-before u-bgYellowLighter"></div>
  <div class="Container">
    <div class="Grid">
      <div class="Grid-cell u-size1of2 u-bgYellowLighter">
        <p class="u-pV10">Cell</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Grid-cell u-size1of2 u-bgRedLighter">
        <p class="u-pV10">Cell</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
___

## After
Use ContainerWrap-after to place the background style on the right and content on the left
```html
<div class="ContainerWrap u-bgYellowLighter">
  <div class="Container">
    <div class="Grid">
      <div class="Grid-cell u-size1of2 u-bgYellowLighter">
        <p class="u-pV10">Cell</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Grid-cell u-size1of2 u-bgRedLighter">
        <p class="u-pV10">Cell</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="ContainerWrap-after u-bgRedLighter"></div>
</div>
```

# Applied in context

## Fullscreen Image-Content Split
Use a Grid with a Grid-cell that has content inside of a Container. The Grid-cell will have an offset that matches the size of the ContainerWrap-before or ContainerWrap-after size 

*Uses [Grid](https://github.com/mutualofomaha/component-grid)*
Doesn't need to be 50%-50%; Use `.u-sizeXofX` if needed
```html
<div class="ContainerWrap u-bgRedLighter">
  <div
    class="ContainerWrap-before Image Image--fluid Image--fullHeight u-hidden u-lg-tableCell"
    style="background-image:url(https://unsplash.imgix.net/photo-1423683249427-8ca22bd873e0?q=75&fm=jpg&s=5e57c661d0f772ce269188a6f5325708?fit=crop&fm=jpg&q=75&w=950)"

          WinWin transfers the user workspace from one computer to another. The transfer is done over some form of network connection - router, network, direct cable or a wireless connection. In order to initial the transfer, the user should run the software on old and new computers, which then auto-locate each other on the network. The transfer is then initiated on the new computer. During the transfer, the old computer is not changed and nothing is removed from it.

## Fullscreen Image with Content partial cover
*Uses [Grid](https://github.com/mutualofomaha/component-grid)*
Doesn't need to be 50%; Use `.u-sizeXofX` if needed
### Content on the Right
Use both the ContainerWrap-before and ContainerWrap-after classes to place content on top of an image

```html
<div class="ContainerWrap">
  <div
    class="ContainerWrap-before u-lg-sizeFull Image Image--fluid Image--fullHeight u-hidden u-lg-tableCell"
    style="background-image:url(https://unsplash.imgix.net/photo-1423683249427-8ca22bd873e0?q=75&fm=jpg&s=5e57c661d0f772ce269188a6f5325708?fit=crop&fm=jpg&q=75&w=950)"
  ></div>
  <div class="Container">

  </div>
  <div class="ContainerWrap-after u-sizeFull u-lg-size1of2 u-bgRedLighter u-opacity9"></div>
</div>
```

### Add a Background Image
To use a background image on either ContainerWrap-before or ContainerWrap-after elements, Image Image--fluid Image--fullHeight classes must also be added. This will expand the background image to the full height and width of the ContainerWrap-before or ContainerWrap-after element.

### Content on the Left
```html
<div class="ContainerWrap">
  <div
    class="ContainerWrap-after u-lg-sizeFull Image Image--fluid Image--fullHeight u-hidden u-lg-tableCell"
    style="background-image:url(https://unsplash.imgix.net/photo-1423683249427-8ca22bd873e0?q=75&fm=jpg&s=5e57c661d0f772ce269188a6f5325708?fit=crop&fm=jpg&q=75&w=950)"

## 3+ Columns

Notably useful in cases where column heights are variable (read: flexbox hack)
