# MoO Utility Size

## sizeFit & sizeFill
Container-type elements can be set to change size depending on their contents. This can also affect other container widths as they will flex in response. In order to set this up, apply the .u-sizeFit class to the container that will have the set width. This width will be determined by the `.u-sizeFit` elementâ€™s children, which should have set widths (such as images or icons). Apply `.u-sizeFill` to the other element which will flex its width accordingly. Please note that `.u-sizeFit` will float its content to the left side of the layout.

```html
<div class="u-cf">
  <div class="u-sizeFit">
    <div class="u-bgRedLighter" style="height:50px;width:50px;"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="u-sizeFill u-bgYellowLighter">
    Content
  </div>
</div>
```

## sizeFit & sizeFill Alt
The alternative version of sizeFit works the same, with the exception that the element will instead float to the right side of the layout. Please note that the class name changes to `.u-sizeFitAlt` as well.

```html
<div class="u-cf">
  <div class="u-sizeFitAlt">
    <div class="u-bgRedLighter" style="height:50px;width:50px;"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="u-sizeFill u-bgYellowLighter">
    Content
  </div>
</div>
```

## sizeFull
Elements that utilize the `.u-sizeFull` class will span across the entire available width allowed by its parent element, and will not be affected by any other sibling layout element.
```html
<div class="u-cf">
  <div class="u-sizeFull u-bgYellowLighter">
    Full
  </div>
</div>
```
___

## sizeFullHeight
The class `.u-sizeFullHeight` works similarly to sizeFull, with the added effect of the element spanning vertically across the entire available layout as well.
```html
<div class="u-cf" style="height: 300px;">
  <div class="u-sizeFull u-sizeFullHeight u-bgYellowLighter">
    Full Height

</div>

## sizeXof2

## Responsive
Multiple classes can be applied to a single container element which will mandate how it appears in a responsive layout. There are three different classes that can be set which represent a width-specific breakpoint: `.u-sm-size[X]of[Y]` for small layouts, `.u-md-size[X]of[Y]` for medium layouts, and `.u-lg-size[X]of[Y]` for large layouts. These classes follow the same construct as the other Size classes, where X is a number of columns within a Y-column layout.
```html
<div class="u-size12of12 u-sm-size9of12 u-md-size6of12 u-lg-size3of12 u-bgYellowLighter">12of12 -&gt; 9of12 -&gt; 6of12 -&gt; 3of12</div>
```
