        Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company is licensed nationwide. This insurance has exclusions, limitations and reductions. An outline of coverage is available upon request. For cost and complete details of coverage, contact a local Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company agent or office. The Guide to Health Insurance for People with Medicare is also available from your state Department of Insurance or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Your Medicare supplement insurance policy will not pay for: any expense incurred before your policy date; services for which no charge is made when there is no insurance; or any expense paid for by Medicare. In some states, if you receive Medicare benefits because of a disability, you may apply for a Medicare supplement insurance policy regardless of your age. In NC, premiums are based on attained age, which means they will increase each year until age 99.
