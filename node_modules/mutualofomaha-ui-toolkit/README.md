## Installation
### On the CDN
* Stylesheet: `//cdn.mutualofomaha.com/css/corporate/{{version}}/style.css`
* Javascript: `//cdn.mutualofomaha.com/js/corporate/{{version}}/scripts.js`
  * *Includes jQuery*

### Build it Yourself
*You'll need node.js. You can get it [here](https://nodejs.org/download/) if you don't already have it.*
* Copy [Gruntfile.js](./example/Gruntfile.js) and [package.example.json](./example/package.json) to the root of your project repo.
* Run `npm install`
  * If you run into problems, chances are it's because of the MoO firewall :boom:
  * Run [these commands](https://gist.github.com/thompsongl/6a229fb6879012a86616) if the above is true.

## Usage
### CSS
* Full:
  * Copy [css_full.css](./example/css_full.css) to your project
  * Edit the postcss config (options, compile, and dist) in your `Gruntfile.js` to point to the correct files
* Custom:
  * Copy [css_custom.css](./example/css_custom.css) to your project
  * Add/Remove the components you want.
  * Edit the postcss config (options, compile, and dist) in your `Gruntfile.js` to point to the correct files

### Sass
* Full:
  * Copy [sass_full.scss](./example/sass_full.scss) to your project
  * Edit the sass and postcss (options, scss, and dist) configs in your `Gruntfile.js` to point to the correct files
* Custom:
  * Copy [sass_custom.scss](./example/sass_custom.scss) to your project
  * Add/Remove the components you want.
  * Edit the sass and postcss (options, scss, and dist) configs in your `Gruntfile.js` to point to the correct files

## Development
This repo is simply an aggregator and builder for component repos. Grunt via [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) and [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) build usable CSS and JavaScript, respectively.

### Component Repos
Most of the code for this repo actually resides elsewhere. Take a look at the `component-*` repos in this organization. :sparkles:Modularity:sparkles:

### Sass
Don't edit the contents of [scss/](./scss). These files are generated by the build task (See above). Your changes will be overwritten on the next `sassify` build.

### Updates
After committing changes to and creating a new tag for a component repo, follow these steps to update the full UI Toolkit build:
* Change the version/tag number in `package.json`
* `npm install --production`
* `grunt sassify compile`
* If successful, `grunt compile`
* Edit `api.md` to reflect changes
* Tag a new release (following semantic versioning) and push to GitHub
* Deploy where needed (see next section)

## Deployment
* `grunt deploy:[itg|cat|prod1|prod2]`: Pushes the contents of `/dist/assets/[css|javascripts]` to the CDN of the desired server
  * Must specify a target (itg, cat, prod1, or prod2)
  * **DANGER ZONE**: This takes the version number from `package.json`, so be sure to bump the version before deploying, or risk overwriting previous versions.
  * If deploying to ITG, you'll first need to be connected to the `dav` drive.
  * Otherwise, this needs your network credentials to access the server, so add them to a new file called `.ftppass` in the project directory root, like so:
  ```
  {
    "key1": {
      "username": "req87455",
      "password": "password"
    }
  }
  ```
